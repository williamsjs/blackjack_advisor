# Description
<p>This program takes user input regarding cards in blackjack and outputs the best choice</p>
<p>The program uses a couple of functions to clean up user input, as well as sets a variable to a boolean value depending on whether or not the user's deck includes an ace.</p>

##Method
<p> I stored each possible value of user card total and dealer's card and tested them against each other by storing them in hashes and iterating over each value, checking to see if it matched the user's value</p>
